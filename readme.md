# Static Preprocessing

*Note: the library is not finished.*

Static preprocessing is a library that includes common functionality for preprocessing static files for use in web apps.

## Features
There are currently no implemented features.

## Planned features
The following features are planned:
- Hashing static files and renaming them.
- Outputting name changes in a file manifest.json for use by the library or by other processes.
- Minifying CSS and JavaScript files.
- Resizing and reformatting images by specification.

## Purpose
This tool is being developed by me, a software engineering student. The reason is that I'm to lazy to perform deployment manually and though it would be cool to automate this process entirely. Because I can't stop myself from overcomplicating things, I use a local MinIO service to store static files. I also wish to offer several formats and sizes of images for optimal web page delivery. It's gotten to a point where I realize this functionality needs to be created as a whole seperate project if I am to manage to develop it for my other projects.

## A note to users
Please be aware of the fact that I don't really know what I'm doing, and I definately have no experience with this sort of tool. As a matter of fact, I would highly discourage the use of this tool for anything other than tinkering.
